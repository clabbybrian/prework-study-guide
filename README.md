# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This site portrays my first attempt at developing a webpage via Github for Northwestern University's Full-stack Coding Bootcamp by leveraging HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript loops & functions, and other related developer concepts. 

The Prework Study Guide was created as a personal means to learn how to structure various forms of code, debug errors (both suggested and independent), follow Git flow, explore online developer community resources, and ultimately become comfortable with the software development process.
